## üîÑ Contribution Process

### 1. Fork and Create Branch
```bash
# Fork the repository and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-guard-github.git
cd supply-chain-guard-github

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Changes
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Update documentation for any configuration changes
- Add or update tests as appropriate
- Ensure all security validations pass

### 3. Testing Requirements
```bash
# Workflow validation
act pull_request -W .github/workflows/supply-chain-security.yml

# JSON validation
jq empty .github/rulesets/*.json

# Network policy validation (if modified)
kubectl apply -f network-policies/ --dry-run=client --validate=true

# Documentation validation
markdownlint docs/*.md README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### 4. Security Validation
- All workflow changes must maintain or improve security posture
- Repository ruleset modifications require security team review
- Network policy changes must not reduce protection effectiveness
- New dependencies require vulnerability scanning approval

### 5. Submit Pull Request
- Use the provided pull request template
- Include clear description of changes and rationale
- Reference related issues using `Fixes #issue-number`
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Request review from appropriate team members

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Security Workflow Standards
- **Action Pinning**: Always pin actions to specific commit SHAs
- **Least Privilege**: Use minimal required permissions
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs and environment variables
- **Secrets Management**: Never expose secrets in logs or outputs

### Repository Ruleset Standards
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing setups
- **Enterprise Scale**: Test with large organization structures
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor rule evaluation performance
- **Documentation**: Update corresponding documentation

### Network Policy Standards
- **Default Deny**: Maintain default-deny egress posture
- **Minimal Allowlist**: Only allow necessary endpoints
- **Protocol Specificity**: Use specific protocols and ports
- **Regular Review**: Include review schedules in documentation

## üß™ Testing Framework

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test security workflow
act pull_request -W .github/workflows/supply-chain-security.yml

# Validate configurations
./scripts/validate-configs.sh

# Check documentation
./scripts/lint-docs.sh
```

### Integration Testing
- Test with multiple GitHub Enterprise versions
- Validate across different runner types (GitHub-hosted, self-hosted)
- Verify organization and enterprise-level deployments
- Test with various repository configurations

### Security Testing
- Validate Harden-Runner monitoring effectiveness
- Test attack simulation scenarios
- Verify compliance with security standards
- Performance impact assessment

## üìñ Documentation Standards
