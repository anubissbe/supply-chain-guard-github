## 🚨 EMERGENCY: Active NPM Supply Chain Attack

**CRITICAL**: There is an active npm supply chain attack with known malicious file hashes.

### Quick Protection (< 1 minute)

```bash
# Emergency deployment script
./scripts/emergency-npm-protection.sh
```

Or manually check for infected files:
```bash
# Check for known malicious hashes
sha256sum $(find . -name "bundle.js" -type f)
# Compare with IOCs in docs/npm-attack-emergency-response.md
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Server
- Organization owner or enterprise admin permissions
- Basic understanding of GitHub Actions workflows
- (Optional) Kubernetes cluster for self-hosted runners

### 30-Second Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-guard-github.git
cd supply-chain-guard-github

# 2. Copy security workflow to your repository
cp .github/workflows/supply-chain-security.yml /path/to/your/repo/.github/workflows/

# 3. Apply organization ruleset (requires org admin)
gh api -X POST /orgs/YOUR_ORG/rulesets \
  --input .github/rulesets/organization-security-ruleset.json

# 4. Trigger workflow and monitor results
gh workflow run "Supply Chain Security Guard" --repo YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO
```

### Implementation Phases

| Phase | Duration | Activities | Outcome |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Phase 1: Assessment** | 1-2 days | Repository audit, runner inventory | Security baseline |
| **Phase 2: Pilot** | 1 week | Deploy to 3-5 repositories | Workflow validation |
| **Phase 3: Rollout** | 2-4 weeks | Organization-wide deployment | Full protection |
| **Phase 4: Optimization** | Ongoing | Monitor, tune, improve | Mature security posture |

## 📊 Security Reporting & Analytics

### 📈 Multi-format Security Reports

Every workflow execution generates comprehensive security artifacts with enterprise-grade reporting:
