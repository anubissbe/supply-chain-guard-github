# Supply‚ÄëChain Guard Kit for **GitHub Enterprise** (Multi‚ÄëOrg)

**Purpose**: A practical, open‚Äësource kit to **prevent**, **verify** and **enforce** S1ngularity‚Äëstyle exfiltration attacks in CI/CD pipelines across GitHub Enterprise organizations.

Focus: **GitHub Enterprise Cloud/Server** with multiple organizations and **self-hosted + GitHub-hosted runners**.

> **TL;DR**
> - Use **StepSecurity Harden‚ÄëRunner** for **runtime monitoring** and **egress control**
> - Enforce **organization-wide** via **Repository Rulesets** that require security workflows
> - Add extra checks (Trivy vulnerability scanning, npm install without scripts)

**Key Advantage**: StepSecurity Harden‚ÄëRunner **natively supports both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners** with comprehensive runtime security monitoring.
