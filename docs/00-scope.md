## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Defense-in-Depth Strategy

#### Layer 1: Runtime Security (StepSecurity Harden-Runner)
- **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** for CI/CD pipelines
- **Network egress monitoring** with real-time alerts
- **File integrity monitoring** for source code protection
- **Process activity tracking** for behavioral analysis

#### Layer 2: Policy Enforcement (Repository Rulesets)
- **Enterprise-wide security policies** with inheritance
- **Mandatory security workflows** as status checks
- **Branch protection** with security requirements
- **Deployment environment** gates and approvals

#### Layer 3: Vulnerability Management (Trivy Scanner)
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** with SBOM generation
- **Container image analysis** for base image security
- **Infrastructure as Code** security scanning
- **License compliance** verification

#### Layer 4: Supply Chain Hygiene
- **Package installation** without script execution
- **Dependency pinning** with hash verification
- **SLSA provenance** generation and attestation
- **Artifact signing** with Sigstore integration

### Network Security Model

```yaml
network_security:
  egress_control:
    default_policy: "deny"
    allowed_endpoints:
      - github.com:443
      - api.github.com:443
      - *.githubusercontent.com:443
      - registry.npmjs.org:443
      - pypi.org:443
      - ghcr.io:443

  monitoring:
    - All connections logged
    - Anomaly detection enabled
    - Real-time alerting
    - Historical analysis

  compliance:
    - Zero Trust architecture
    - Least privilege access
    - Network segmentation
    - Encrypted communications
```
