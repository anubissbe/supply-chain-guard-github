### Advanced Supply Chain Attack Pattern

#### Attack Lifecycle
```yaml
attack_pattern:
  stage_1_compromise:
    vectors:
      - Malicious dependency with postinstall scripts
      - Compromised build tool or plugin
      - Supply chain package hijacking
      - Insider threat or account compromise

  stage_2_execution:
    techniques:
      - Lifecycle script execution (npm, pip, etc.)
      - Build-time code injection
      - Configuration manipulation

      - Environment variables (GITHUB_TOKEN, AWS_KEYS)
      - File system secrets (.env, .npmrc, config files)
      - Memory dumps for runtime secrets
      - Network-accessible services

  stage_4_exfiltration:
    methods:
      - HTTPS POST to attacker infrastructure
      - DNS tunneling for stealthy exfiltration
      - Webhook abuse for data transmission
      - Cloud storage misuse

  stage_5_impact:
    consequences:
      - Source code theft
      - Production deployment compromise
      - Lateral movement to cloud infrastructure
      - Supply chain propagation
```

    }
  }
};
```

### Layer 2: Organization-Wide Policy Enforcement

  inheritance_model:
    enterprise:
      priority: 1
      override: false
      scope: "all_organizations"

    organization:
      priority: 2
      override: "with_approval"
      scope: "all_repositories"

    repository:
      priority: 3
      override: "never"
      scope: "local"

  enforcement_rules:
    required_workflows:
      - supply-chain-security.yml

### Layer 4: Supply Chain Hygiene

#### Package Installation Security

```bash
# Node.js Protection Strategy
npm_security() {
  # Never execute lifecycle scripts during installation
  npm ci --ignore-scripts

  # Audit for known vulnerabilities
  npm audit --audit-level=moderate

  # Verify package integrity
  npm ci --integrity-check

  # Use lockfile for reproducible builds
  npm ci --frozen-lockfile
}

# Python Protection Strategy
python_security() {
  # Hash verification for all packages
  pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt

  # No code execution during install
  pip install --no-deps --no-binary :all:

  # Vulnerability scanning
  safety check --json

  # SBOM generation
  pip-audit --format cyclonedx
}

# Container Protection Strategy
container_security() {
  # Minimal base images
  FROM gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot

  # No package managers in production
  RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt \
      apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends

  # Vulnerability scanning at build
  RUN trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .
}
```
