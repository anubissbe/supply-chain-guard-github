# GitHub Enterprise Cloud Compatibility Guide

## What You Have: GitHub Enterprise Cloud

Based on the documentation link you provided:
- **Product**: GitHub Enterprise Cloud (github.com with Enterprise features)
- **Ruleset Support**: ✅ FULL SUPPORT
- **Required Workflows**: ⚠️ LIMITED (gradual rollout)
- **Documentation**: https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/

## Available Protection Methods for GitHub Enterprise Cloud

### ✅ Method 1: Organization Rulesets (FULLY SUPPORTED)

**This is what you should use!** Organization rulesets are fully supported and documented in the link you provided.

#### What Organization Rulesets Can Do:

1. **Apply to ALL repositories** in the organization (1600 repos across 10 orgs)
2. **Require status checks** from workflows to pass
3. **Block merges and pushes** if checks fail
4. **No need to modify individual pipelines**
5. **Centrally managed** at organization level
6. **Full audit history** available

#### How It Works:

```
Organization Ruleset
    ↓
Requires "NPM Security Check" status
    ↓
If workflow fails → Block merge/push
    ↓
ALL repositories protected instantly
```

### ⚠️ Method 2: Required Workflows (LIMITED AVAILABILITY)

GitHub is gradually rolling this out to Enterprise Cloud customers. Check if available at:
`https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR-ENTERPRISE/settings/actions`

If you see "Required workflows" → You can use it
If not → Use Organization Rulesets instead

## Implementation for Your 1600 Repositories

### Step 1: Deploy Security Workflow to Central Repository

Create ONE central repository with the security workflow:

```bash
# Create central security repository
gh repo create YOUR-ORG/security-workflows --public

# Add the security workflow
cat > .github/workflows/npm-security.yml << 'EOF'
name: NPM Security Check
on:
  workflow_call:  # Can be called by other repos
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  security-check:
    name: NPM Security Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Check for malicious npm packages
        run: |
          # Your security check script here
          # (checking for the 4 malicious hashes)
EOF
```

### Step 2: Deploy Organization Rulesets

Run the deployment script for all 10 organizations:

```bash
# Edit the script to add your organization names
vi scripts/deploy-org-ruleset-enterprise-cloud.sh

# Run deployment
./scripts/deploy-org-ruleset-enterprise-cloud.sh
```

### Step 3: Add Minimal Workflow to Each Repository

**IMPORTANT**: You need ONE small workflow in each repository that calls the security check and reports status. This can be done via automation:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-check.yml (in each repo)
name: Security Status
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  call-security:
    uses: YOUR-ORG/security-workflows/.github/workflows/npm-security.yml@main
```

Deploy this minimal workflow using the mass deployment script:

```bash
./scripts/enterprise-mass-deployment.sh
```

## What Gets Protected

With Organization Rulesets configured:

1. **ALL 1600 repositories** in your 10 organizations
2. **ALL branches** (main, master, develop, release/*)
3. **ALL pull requests** cannot be merged if security fails
4. **ALL pushes** are checked (depending on configuration)
5. **NO bypass** unless explicitly configured

## Verification

### Check Ruleset is Active:

```bash
# For each organization
gh api /orgs/YOUR-ORG/rulesets --jq '.[] | {name: .name, enforcement: .enforcement}'
```

### View Ruleset History:

As mentioned in your documentation link, you can view history at:
`https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORG/settings/rules`

Click on the ruleset → "History" tab to see:
- Who created/modified it
- When changes were made
- What changed

## FAQ

**Q: Is this compatible with current GitHub Enterprise Cloud?**
A: YES, Organization Rulesets are fully supported in GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

**Q: Do I need to modify 1600 build pipelines?**
A: NO, but you need to add ONE small workflow that reports security status. This can be automated.

**Q: Will this block builds?**
A: YES, if the security check fails, the ruleset prevents merging and can block pushes.

**Q: Can users bypass this?**
A: NO, unless they are explicitly added to the bypass list in the ruleset.

**Q: What if Required Workflows becomes available?**
A: You can switch to it later for even simpler management (no per-repo workflow needed).

## Summary

Your GitHub Enterprise Cloud FULLY SUPPORTS Organization Rulesets as described in the documentation you linked. This provides:

1. **Central enforcement** across all 1600 repositories
2. **No need to modify existing build pipelines**
3. **Full blocking capability** for merges and pushes
4. **Complete audit history** and visibility
5. **Enterprise-grade protection** against the npm attack

The solution is fully compatible and ready to deploy!
